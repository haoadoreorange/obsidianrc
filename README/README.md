# obsidianrc
My [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) config.
## Usage
- Clone this repo in vault as `.obsidian`
- Run `git worktree add ../obsidianrc obsidianrc` (this is because the actual `.obsidian/` content cannot be in a sub-directory to avoid working with symlink, hence for Obsidian to access other files in here, it needs to be added as another directory in root visible to Obsidian)
- Setup vault directory structure following `example-vault`.
